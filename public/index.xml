      <title>Games IHG</title>

      <description>I was contacted by the design agency V09 to help them create a new digital solution for their client. I also been helping IHG for different design projects for the last 5 years. I know them very well, I’ve been in their offices many times and that familiarity from both sides helped to have a smooth process.
V09 had some ideas but they were not sure if they were possible, they wanted a personalized game but the budget didn’t allow them to consider developing a native app/game.</description>

      <description>I’ve been helping Chromite for many years now since I was still in college, so I know the company quite well. At the beginning I help them with some editorial design, updating their product catalogs. I never liked their image but they were using it the same logo, fonts, and colors for all these years, they weren’t very keen to change all of it.
Years passed by and I kept working with them on other projects, one day while trying to fit my designs in their very outdated branding, I just had enough.</description>

      <description>If you go and look for recycling businesses you get flooded with the ♻️ symbols, leaves and bright greenish colors. We wanted to move away from that, I went for other ways to differentiate and represent it. Taking references from the main focus of the company, tires, I took advantage of the name as is already very descriptive, so I opted for something subtle and abstract.
I came up with a round shape representing a tire, they’re similar figures around in a disorderly manner, symbolizing the pollution and waste.</description>

      <description>Just starting the project I found interesting how different you can represent the two main services they offer. I wanted a rememberable mark for the company, is not easy to create an element that embodies cleaning and security at the same time. The other problem is they offer other small services for some of their clients, so the best was focus on the name as it already has a big meaning for his clients (Extra Services).</description>

      <description>A lot of things have been going on this year, and I feel bad by keeping this blog so abandoned. There’s many changes on my site though, and way more activity but more on that later.
As my last blog post is about my return to fighting I start with those updates.
Fighting I fought two times this year, one in March that while I felt good on the first round I end up losing in the second.</description>

      <description>Last week, after almost 2 years without fighting. Past months full of problems, life-changing events, inactivity and a long recovery from an injury; I entered the cage again.
While I got to focus more on my design career and I even thought for a moment that it may be time to hang the gloves. As time pass I didn’t feel like myself and wasn’t happy with this version of me, I realize that a daily training regime and most importantly… High-level challenges.</description>

      <description>A couple months ago, Frank Chimero, a great designer that I’d admired for a long time, wrote about the pain to re-learn many things in the web to keep yourself updated to the latest practices and trends. That post hit right on me as he expressed all my recent frustrations and everything I wanted to said but better.
First, let me start from the beginning. You see, I started learning about this web thing when I was in college studying graphic design and in all those years we end up having one little intro course of this newer area of design called “Web Design”.</description>

      <description>This morning I launched my new website. I used to be one of those designers that never reserved time for my brand, only working for clients and never on myself. As a result, I’ve never been really proud of my site.
I need to go back in history to my first portfolio site, that I superstitiously launch on September 9th, 2009 (09/09/09) looking for a bit of luck, raining clients or some kind of help.</description>

      <description>I had a wild 2017, not exactly in a good way. Many sad events happened to my family in that year, thankfully our newborn helped us a lot. It gave us those moments of joy we needed.
During many months I lost focus in my training and work, but I needed to get back on my feet. So I started a new business inspired by the trend of productizing your services, aimed to create websites for small companies.</description>

      <title>The Benefit of Constraints</title>

      <description>When I was starting as a designer I regularly complain about restriction, feeling that I needed complete freedom to release my creativity.
I was young and didn’t fear the blank canvas, I would immediately start throwing and moving stuff around but all my results didn’t had any real authenticity and didn’t solve the problem effectively, just trendy designs all over the place, they represent what style I was inspired by in that moment.</description>

      <title>Best resource to learn UI / UX</title>
      <link>https://v3.ramiroruiz.com/blog/best-resource-to-learn-ui-ux/</link>

      <description>The best resource is understanding English.
Design is a discipline in constant evolution, the foundations and fundamentals will always be important but the implementation, channels, trends, and people change. So you have to be in constant movement and learning.
When you add that the design is aimed at the web or digital products, the speed of how things change increases exponentially. The source of most changes comes from the United States, thanks to its large market, its startups and global popularity, which is why the importance of English.</description>

      <description>A couple of months ago my father stayed in the hospital around 3 weeks, as in most places in the world, healthcare is very expensive, so he has social insurance which gives you medical care but it comes with a price. Hospitals are packed, few places to sit, little information and I don’t even want to talk about the restrooms.
You’ll see the mid to low income population in those places.</description>

      <description>On July 23, 2017, I experienced the worst accident I have ever had in my life.
It was a long-awaited weekend, where we went to Cuatrocienegas to have a great time with the family. Everything was excellent and wonderful, we finished going to the main places, the only place that was left before returning home was the marble mine, being there and having seen all I just had this urge to climb the highest stone (8-10 meters approx.</description>

      <description>On my birthday 5 years and 6 months ago on September 9, 2012, I wrote this:
 Hi there, well after so many years being part of the web passive community, today in my birthday I finally decided to make the change and start sharing the little I know and the many questions I ask myself constantly. Maybe I’m starting a bit late but I think I&amp;rsquo;ll take positive things from this instead of not doing it, besides I&amp;rsquo;m a little tired of being one more behind the monitor, of not having my own voice on the web and staying in my area of comfort in a relatively comfortable and stable job.</description>
