      <description>This morning I launched my new website. I used to be one of those designers that never reserved time for my brand, only working for clients and never on myself. As a result, I’ve never been really proud of my site.

      <description>When I was starting as a designer I regularly complain about restriction, feeling that I needed complete freedom to release my creativity.

      <description>The best resource is understanding English.
Design is a discipline in constant evolution, the foundations and fundamentals will always be important but the implementation, channels, trends, and people change. So you have to be in constant movement and learning.
When you add that the design is aimed at the web or digital products, the speed of how things change increases exponentially. The source of most changes comes from the United States, thanks to its large market, its startups and global popularity, which is why the importance of English.</description>
