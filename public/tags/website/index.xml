      <description>A lot of things have been going on this year, and I feel bad by keeping this blog so abandoned. Thereâ€™s many changes on my site though, and way more activity but more on that later.
As my last blog post is about my return to fighting I start with those updates.
Fighting I fought two times this year, one in March that while I felt good on the first round I end up losing in the second.</description>
