      <description>I was contacted by the design agency V09 to help them create a new digital solution for their client. I also been helping IHG for different design projects for the last 5 years. I know them very well, I’ve been in their offices many times and that familiarity from both sides helped to have a smooth process.
V09 had some ideas but they were not sure if they were possible, they wanted a personalized game but the budget didn’t allow them to consider developing a native app/game.</description>
