      <description>I’ve been helping Chromite for many years now since I was still in college, so I know the company quite well. At the beginning I help them with some editorial design, updating their product catalogs. I never liked their image but they were using it the same logo, fonts, and colors for all these years, they weren’t very keen to change all of it.
Years passed by and I kept working with them on other projects, one day while trying to fit my designs in their very outdated branding, I just had enough.</description>

      <description>If you go and look for recycling businesses you get flooded with the ♻️ symbols, leaves and bright greenish colors. We wanted to move away from that, I went for other ways to differentiate and represent it. Taking references from the main focus of the company, tires, I took advantage of the name as is already very descriptive, so I opted for something subtle and abstract.
I came up with a round shape representing a tire, they’re similar figures around in a disorderly manner, symbolizing the pollution and waste.</description>

      <description>Just starting the project I found interesting how different you can represent the two main services they offer. I wanted a rememberable mark for the company, is not easy to create an element that embodies cleaning and security at the same time. The other problem is they offer other small services for some of their clients, so the best was focus on the name as it already has a big meaning for his clients (Extra Services).</description>
