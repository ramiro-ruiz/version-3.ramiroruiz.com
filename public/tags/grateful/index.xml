      <description>A couple of months ago my father stayed in the hospital around 3 weeks, as in most places in the world, healthcare is very expensive, so he has social insurance which gives you medical care but it comes with a price. Hospitals are packed, few places to sit, little information and I don’t even want to talk about the restrooms.
You’ll see the mid to low income population in those places.</description>
