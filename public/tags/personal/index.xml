      <description>A lot of things have been going on this year, and I feel bad by keeping this blog so abandoned. There’s many changes on my site though, and way more activity but more on that later.
As my last blog post is about my return to fighting I start with those updates.
Fighting I fought two times this year, one in March that while I felt good on the first round I end up losing in the second.</description>

      <description>Last week, after almost 2 years without fighting. Past months full of problems, life-changing events, inactivity and a long recovery from an injury; I entered the cage again.
While I got to focus more on my design career and I even thought for a moment that it may be time to hang the gloves. As time pass I didn’t feel like myself and wasn’t happy with this version of me, I realize that a daily training regime and most importantly… High-level challenges.</description>
